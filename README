I attempt to add an ui to interrupt the optimizer so that the user can do some
final modificaitons.

building instructions:
# add these to .bashrc
export PG_DB=$HOME/pgdb
export PG_BUILD=$HOME/pgbuild
export PATH=$PATH:$PG_BUILD/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PG_BUILD/lib
mkdir -p $PG_BUILD
mkdir -p $PG_DB

# run these from repo root
# disable optimization (makes it easier to line by line debug)
./configure CFLAGS=-O0 --enable-debug --enable-cassert --prefix=$PG_BUILD
# treat warnings as errors
echo COPT=-Werror > src/Makefile.custom
make
make install

# these can be run from anywhere
initdb --locale=C -D $PG_DB
postmaster -p 13370 -D $PG_DB
createdb -p 13370 mytest

PostgreSQL Database Management System
=====================================

This directory contains the source code distribution of the PostgreSQL
database management system.

PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system
that supports an extended subset of the SQL standard, including
transactions, foreign keys, subqueries, triggers, user-defined types
and functions.  This distribution also contains C language bindings.

PostgreSQL has many language interfaces, many of which are listed here:

See the file INSTALL for instructions on how to build and install
PostgreSQL.  That file also lists supported operating systems and
hardware platforms and contains information regarding any other
software packages that are required to build or run the PostgreSQL
system.  Copyright and license information can be found in the
file COPYRIGHT.  A comprehensive documentation set is included in this
distribution; it can be read as described in the installation
instructions.

The latest version of this software may be obtained at
http://www.postgresql.org/download/.  For more information look at our
web site located at http://www.postgresql.org/.
